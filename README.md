# Easy Patient Letters (Starter)

The exercise is based on the following scenario: you enter a patient letter and submit it for analysis. A Large Language Model (LLM) – in this case a model you deployed through Microsoft Azure AI Foundry – will run an analysis and extract / interpret certain key points of the letter.

An example could be a summary of the diagnosis in easy-to-understand language; or a recipe suggestion based on provided nutritional information. But what exactly is up to you. For the user, these questions are shown in a nicely formatted way, with the type of information and the provided summary of the LLM.
